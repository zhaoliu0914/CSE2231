# CSE 2231 Software II: Software Development and Design
Data representation using hashing, search trees, and linked data structures;\
Algorithms for sorting;\
Using trees for language processing;\
Component interface design;\
Best practices in Java.

## Learning Outcomes
- Be competent with using design-by-contract principles and related best practices, including separation of abstract state from concrete representation
- Be competent with using interface contracts, representation invariants, and abstraction functions that are described using simple predicate calculus assertions with mathematical integer, string, finite set, and tuple models
- Be competent with extending existing software components by layering new operations on top of existing operations
- Be competent with layering new software components' data representations on top of existing software components
- Be familiar with simple linked data representations, including why and when it is (and is not) appropriate to use them rather than layered data representations
- Be competent with using simple recursion
- Be competent with using simple techniques to test application software, layered implementations of extensions, and layered or linked data representations, including developing and carrying out simple specification-based test plans
- Be competent with using simple techniques to debug application software, layered implementations of extensions, and typical data representations
- Be familiar with using basic algorithm analysis techniques and notations to analyze and express execution times of operations whose implementations involve straight-line code, simple loops, and simple recursion (e.g., in manipulating binary trees)
- Be competent with writing Java programs using core language features including interfaces, classes, inheritance, and assertions
- Be competent with writing Java programs that use software components similar to (but simplified from) those in the Java collections framework
- Be familiar with using many industry-standard "best practices" for Java design and development
- Be familiar with working as part of a team on a software project with multiple milestones
- Be exposed to using a version control system, e.g., CVS or SVN
